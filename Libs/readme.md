Built libs are provided for ease of compilation, the `Built` folder is set up as a local nuget source where you can just drop your own versions.

The libs added as submodules are just to keep track of the source, they're forks i made to do minor changes:
- Linux arm support for libusbdotnet
- Build as nupkg and remove NLog dependency from SharpRTSP
